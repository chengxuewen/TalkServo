# Docker & Network Constraints

> **TalkServo calibration (D11, 2026-09-28)**: docker-cargo.sh is a CI-parity fallback here, not the default dev loop (Linux-native-first). Volume-mount and first-build notes below describe the macOS/Docker pain we deliberately avoid on this host; mediasoup UDP port-range and ICE/STUN constraints remain fully in force.

## Docker Constraints

### Docker Desktop Volume Mount Performance
- Docker Desktop on macOS uses **osxfs (legacy) or virtiofs (newer)** for bind mounts. Both are **3-5x slower** than native Linux filesystem access.
- The `cargo-cache` named volume in the compose files (P0-1) mitigates this for dependency downloads, but **workspace source code bind mounts are still slow**.
- **Mitigation**: Prefer `docker compose exec` for running cargo commands inside the container rather than relying on host-side tooling. Avoid running `cargo build` from a host-mounted volume for large builds — use the container's internal filesystem or a dedicated volume.
- First-time `cargo build` with `sfu-mediasoup` inside Docker can take **15-30 minutes** (vs. 3-5 minutes for native Linux).

## Network Constraints

### UDP Port Range for mediasoup
- mediasoup Worker RTP/RTCP uses **UDP ports 40000-40100** by default.
- Port mapping in the compose files (P0-1):
  ```
  40000-40100:40000-40100/udp
  ```
- When deploying outside Docker, ensure the host firewall allows this UDP range. For production, narrow the range (e.g., `rtc_ports_range: (40000, 40100)`) — fewer ports reduce firewall surface area.

### ICE/STUN Required for Local P2P
- WebRTC (even on localhost) requires **ICE negotiation** with STUN to discover candidate pairs. Without a STUN server, localhost WebRTC connections fail because no candidate pairs are formed.
- **Development setup**: Run a STUN server (e.g., `coturn` or `stuntman`) locally, or configure the WebRTC transport to use a host-loopback ICE candidate.
- **Common gotcha**: Host and Client on the same machine assume localhost WebRTC "just works" — it does not. ICE must be configured explicitly even for loopback connections.
- mediasoup's `WebRtcTransport` uses ICE-Lite (server-side) by default, which reduces the ICE handshake to one round trip but still requires the client to send a STUN binding request.
